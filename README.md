Some scripts for some Roblox games.

## What's a Lua executor?
A Lua executor for Roblox is a program that executes scripts and such the give yourself an advantage, though for legal purposes, I greatly discourage using this newfound strength against others. ;)
I use [KRNL](https://krnl.ca "KRNL download page") to execute scripts, and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code download page") to make scripts. If KRNL asks you for a key, I will have a video uploaded on my channel about it before December 15th, 2021.
